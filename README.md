Text Classification is a process involved in Sentiment Analysis


ðŸš€ Welcome to the Text Classification using LSTM project! In this repository, I've explored the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify sentiments in Twitter tweets.

## Project Overview

Text Classification is a powerful technique in NLP that involves categorizing people's opinions and expressions into different sentiments. In this project, I've taken it a step further by not only classifying sentiments as Positive, Neutral, and Negative but also into Review Ratings and emotions like Happy or Sad.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing**: I've employed advanced techniques like stemming and lemmatization to transform words into their root forms, ensuring accurate sentiment analysis.

- **Cleaning Twitter Data**: Twitter tweets often contain hyperlinks, mentions, and stopwords. Using Python's NLTK library, I've efficiently handled these challenges.

- **Tokenization**: To make text more manageable for analysis, I've implemented tokenization, breaking down the text into tokens.

- **Sequence Modeling**: Leveraging the power of Keras, I've constructed a sequence model using `pad_sequence`, a crucial step in NLP.
